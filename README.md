# Awesomeness Overflow
-------------

## Set Up
1. Make sure that you have the latest version of node.js installed.
2. Install the source files.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to `/webapp` and type in `npm install`
4. In your terminal or command prompt, type in `npm start` to run the application.

## Caveats
The second visualization requires the use of the neo4j database service which should most likely be unavailable at this
point in time due to high server costs. Unless you are Prof. Kam (in which please email amos.tan.2014@sis.smu.edu.sg), I
regret to inform you that only the beautiful user interface will be available for your viewing pleasure.
